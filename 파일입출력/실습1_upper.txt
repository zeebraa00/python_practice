EMINEM - MOCKINGBIRD

YEAH
I KNOW SOMETIMES THINGS MAY NOT
ALWAYS MAKE SENSE TO YOU RIGHT NOW
BUT HEY
WHAT DADDY ALWAYS TELL YOU?
STRAIGHTEN UP LITTLE SOLDIER
STIFFEN UP THAT UPPER LIP
WHAT YOU CRYING ABOUT?
YOU GOT ME
HAILIE I KNOW YOU MISS YOUR MOM AND I KNOW YOU MISS YOUR DAD
WELL I'M GONE BUT I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE LIFE THAT I NEVER HAD
I CAN SEE YOU'RE SAD, EVEN WHEN YOU SMILE, EVEN WHEN YOU LAUGH
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES, DEEP INSIDE YOU WANT TO CRY
CAUSE YOU'RE SCARED, I AIN'T THERE?
DADDY'S WITH YOU IN YOUR PRAYERS
NO MORE CRYING, WIPE THEM TEARS
DADDY'S HERE, NO MORE NIGHTMARES
WE GON' PULL TOGETHER THROUGH IT, WE GON' DO IT
LANEY UNCLE'S CRAZY, AIN'T HE?
YEAH BUT HE LOVES YOU GIRL AND YOU BETTER KNOW IT
WE'RE ALL WE GOT IN THIS WORLD
WHEN IT SPINS, WHEN IT SWIRLS
WHEN IT WHIRLS, WHEN IT TWIRLS
TWO LITTLE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS
LOOKIN' PUZZLED, IN A DAZE
I KNOW IT'S CONFUSING YOU
DADDY'S ALWAYS ON THE MOVE, MAMA'S ALWAYS ON THE NEWS
I TRY TO KEEP YOU SHELTERED FROM IT BUT SOMEHOW IT SEEMS
THE HARDER THAT I TRY TO DO THAT, THE MORE IT BACKFIRES ON ME
ALL THE THINGS GROWING UP HIS DADDY THAT HE HAD TO SEE
DADDY DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE BUT YOU SEE JUST AS MUCH AS HE DID
WE DID NOT PLAN IT TO BE THIS WAY, YOUR MOTHER AND ME
BUT THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SO BAD BETWEEN US
I DON'T SEE US EVER BEING TOGETHER EVER AGAIN
LIKE WE USED TO BE WHEN WE WERE TEENAGERS
BUT THEN OF COURSE EVERYTHING ALWAYS HAPPENS FOR A REASON
I GUESS IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE
BUT IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER AND THAT'S WHAT DESTINY IS
BUT NO MORE WORRIES, REST YOUR HEAD AND GO TO SLEEP
MAYBE ONE DAY WE'LL WAKE UP AND THIS WILL ALL JUST BE A DREAM
NOW HUSH LITTLE BABY, DON'T YOU CRY
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT
STIFFEN THAT UPPER LIP UP LITTLE LADY, I TOLD YA
DADDY'S HERE TO HOLD YA THROUGH THE NIGHT
I KNOW MOMMY'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY
WE FEAR HOW WE FEEL INSIDE
IT MAY SEEM A LITTLE CRAZY, PRETTY BABY
BUT I PROMISE MOMMA'S GON' BE ALRIGHT
IT'S FUNNY
I REMEMBER BACK ONE YEAR WHEN DADDY HAD NO MONEY
MOMMY WRAPPED THE CHRISTMAS PRESENTS UP
AND STUCK 'EM UNDER THE TREE AND SAID SOME OF 'EM WERE FROM ME
CAUSE DADDY COULDN'T BUY 'EM
I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT CHRISTMAS I SAT UP THE WHOLE NIGHT CRYING
CAUSE DADDY FELT LIKE A BUM, SEE DADDY HAD A JOB
BUT HIS JOB WAS TO KEEP THE FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR YOU AND MOM
AND AT THE TIME EVERY HOUSE THAT WE LIVED IN
EITHER KEPT GETTING BROKEN INTO AND ROBBED
OR SHOT UP ON THE BLOCK AND YOUR MOM WAS SAVING MONEY FOR YOU IN A JAR
TRYNA START A PIGGY BANK FOR YOU SO YOU COULD GO TO COLLEGE
ALMOST HAD A THOUSAND DOLLARS TILL SOMEONE BROKE IN AND STOLE IT
AND I KNOW IT HURT SO BAD IT BROKE YOUR MOMMA'S HEART
AND IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS JUST STARTIN' TO FALL APART
MOM AND DAD WAS ARGUIN' A LOT SO MOMMA MOVED BACK
ON THE CHALMERS IN THE FLAT ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT
AND DAD MOVED BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF 8 MILE ON NOVARA
AND THAT'S WHEN DADDY WENT TO CALIFORNIA WITH HIS CD AND MET DR. DRE
AND FLEW YOU AND MOMMA OUT TO SEE ME
BUT DADDY HAD TO WORK, YOU AND MOMMA HAD TO LEAVE ME
THEN YOU STARTED SEEING DADDY ON THE T.V. AND MOMMA DIDN'T LIKE IT
AND YOU AND LANEY WERE TO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND IT
PAPA WAS A ROLLIN' STONE, MOMMA DEVELOPED A HABIT
AND IT ALL HAPPENED TOO FAST FOR EITHER ONE OF US TO GRAB IT
I'M JUST SORRY YOU WERE THERE AND HAD TO WITNESS IT FIRST HAND
CAUSE ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO WAS JUST MAKE YOU PROUD
NOW I'M SITTING IN THIS EMPTY HOUSE, JUST REMINISCING
LOOKIN' AT YOUR BABY PICTURES, IT JUST TRIPS ME OUT
TO SEE HOW MUCH YOU BOTH HAVE GROWN, IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE SISTERS NOW
WOW, GUESS YOU PRETTY MUCH ARE AND DADDY'S STILL HERE
LANEY I'M TALKIN' TO YOU TOO, DADDY'S STILL HERE
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT, YEAH
IT'S GOT A RING TO IT DON'T IT?
SHH, MOMMA'S ONLY GONE FOR THE MOMENT
NOW HUSH LITTLE BABY, DON'T YOU CRY
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT
STIFFEN THAT UPPER LIP UP LITTLE LADY, I TOLD YA
DADDY'S HERE TO HOLD YA THROUGH THE NIGHT
I KNOW MOMMY'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY
WE FEAR HOW WE FEEL INSIDE
IT MAY SEEM A LITTLE CRAZY, PRETTY BABY
BUT I PROMISE MOMMA'S GON' BE ALRIGHT
AND IF YOU ASK ME TOO DADDY'S GONNA BUY YOU A MOCKINGBIRD
I'MMA GIVE YOU THE WORLD
I'MMA BUY A DIAMOND RING FOR YOU
I'MMA SING FOR YOU
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU TO SEE YOU SMILE
AND IF THAT MOCKINGBIRD DON'T SING AND THAT RING DON'T SHINE
I'MMA BREAK THAT BIRDIES NECK
I'LL GO BACK TO THE JEWELER WHO SOLD IT TO YA
AND MAKE HIM EAT EVERY CARAT DON'T FUCK WITH DAD (HA HA)
